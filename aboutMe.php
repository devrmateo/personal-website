          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>In addition to developing websites, I am the primary caregiver for my two young children, so I don't have much free time.  When I do have a moment, I enjoy reading, watching movies and keeping up with my favorite soccer team, Fútbol Club Barcelona.  My wife, Rebeca, and I have been married for twelve years.  We met in Madrid, Spain while we were both on study abroad programs, and got married in Barcelona several years later (see the "Related" section for information on the church where we got married).</p>
