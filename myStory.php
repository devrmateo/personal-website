          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>I became interested in web development in 2004, when I created a portfolio website as part of a class assignment in my doctoral program in Spanish.  At that time, I had no knowledge of coding whatsoever.  In fact, I utilized Dreamweaver's graphical user interface to complete the project without writing a single line of code.</p>
          <p>However, by the time the class was over, I had become thoroughly interested in the process of web development.  The following year, I volunteered to create the website for the department's annual graduate student symposium, and the year after that I became the webmaster for the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. During the three years that I served in this capacity, I taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, a server-side language called CFML, or ColdFusion, and the database language SQL.</p>
          <p>In 2016, over ten years after creating my first portfolio website, I decided to return to web development with the goal of making it a career.  To reach this objective, I began by completing Udacity's <em>Intro to Programming</em> Nanodegree, an online, self-paced program, with mentorship included.  Here I again learned about HTML and CSS, in addition to the Python programming language, as well as concepts such as functions, variables, loops, classes and objects.</p>
          <p>After completing the Nanodegree, I enrolled in another online course, <em>The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0</em>, on Udemy, which I completed in 2017.  As a result, I now have certifications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.  Additionally, during the 2017-2018 school year, I was the webmaster for a preschool website run with WordPress.  In 2018, I completed Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree after earning a full scholarship through the Grow With Google Initiative.  During the program I won the student story competition and earned another scholarship to the React Nanodegree program, which I completed in June of 2019.</p>
          <p>More important than the knowledge and certifications that I have acquired, however, is the evolution of my approach to web development as a discipline.  I now realize that programming and web development are primarily problem-solving fields, and I have become a much more proficient problem-solver.  I enjoy building things and learning as I go.  As I move forward with various projects, I know that I will encounter challenges.  Nevertheless, I am confident in my ability to overcome any potential obstacles through the use of a methodical problem-solving approach, coupled with patience and determination.</p>
