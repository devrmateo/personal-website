          <h2>Teaching</h2>
          <p>I realized that I was passionate about teaching while I was living in Spain, working as an English teacher.  When I returned to the US, I got my Master's in Teacher Education from Ursuline College, in Pepper Pike, Ohio.  After graduating, I taught high school Spanish for two years at Saint Edward High School in Lakewood, Ohio.  I then enrolled in a Master's in Spanish program at Bowling Green State University, something that would allow me to teach in a higher education setting.  Following my graduation, I taught for a year as a visiting professor at Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Realizing that this was the environment I wanted to be in, I decided to pursue a doctoral degree in Hispanic Literature, which I did at the University of Arizona.
          After graduating with my doctorate, I obtained employment as a full-time Spanish instructor at Pima Community College, in Tucson, Arizona, where I worked for two years before moving to Southern California. For the past six years I have worked as an adjunct Spanish instructor at Fullerton College and Rio Hondo College.</p>
          <h4 class="midPageHeader" id="philosophy">Teaching Philosophy</h4>
          <p>When teaching second language courses I am guided by the principles put forth by Stephen D. Krashen and Tracey D. Terrell in their seminal work on the subject, <em>The Natural Approach</em>. What the authors propose is that there is a distinction between “acquiring” a language and “learning” one. Language acquisition occurs naturally and subconsciously, similar to the way a small child acquires her first language. Language learning, on the other hand, is conscious learning, about the rules of a language, for example. In order for acquisition to occur, learners need to be exposed to oral and written discourse in the target language that is accesible to them. In my classes, I talk to my students in Spanish in a way that they can understand.</p>
          <p>When I teach Heritage, or native Spanish speakers, I remain focused on communicative competence, although with a slightly different methodology. In contrast to second language learners, who begin the course with minimal proficiency in Spanish, heritage learners normally come to class with greater skill levels. Since they are surrounded by the language at home, they can understand it and perhaps speak it well. However, where they tend to need help is in their writing. Therefore, I utilize their strengths–their oral comprehension–to remediate their weaknesses–their writing skills. One of the techniques I use to do this is to have students complete oral transcriptions, of movie scenes, for example. Once they begin to make the transfer from the oral into the written, they can then begin to take on progressively more complex writing tasks.
          </p>
          <p>I also believe that technology has great potential to improve communicative competence and foster language acquisition. To achieve this, I leverage the Learning Management System in place at the institution where I am teaching, in combination with the technology that the students themselves bring to class, such as mobile devices and headphones.  For example, I play short audio and video selections in the target language, and project relevant course files onto the screen. Students then utilize their mobile devices and headphones to take related assessments that frequently include audio and video recordings. Additionally, students always have access to the many language and cultural resources that I post online so that they may continue their acquisition outside of class. Another important feature of learning management systems is the grade book, something I take advantage of by posting students’ grades online. This increases their awareness and motivation, leading to greater student success.</p>
