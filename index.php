          <p class="first">I am a detail-oriented Front-End Web Developer with certifications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL. Recently, I completed Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, for which I earned a full scholarship through the Grow With Google Initiative.</p>
          <p>Before becoming a web developer, I taught college Spanish for twenty years.  This prior experience in the humanities lends me a unique insight into the tech world (see the article in the "Related" section).  It is clear that you need to have the requisite knowledge and skills to be a successful developer.  Nonetheless, the manner in which you approach problems is even more important.  I utilize my well-honed critical thinking skills to identify potential challenges in any project that I am working on, and then I ask the right questions to go about overcoming them.</p>
          <p>Explore this website to get to know a little bit more about me.  If you're interested, get in touch using the contact form.  I look forward to helping you add value to your personal life, business or organization.</p>
