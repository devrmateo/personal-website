          <p class="first">I am a Full Stack Web Developer with proficiency in React, Redux, React Native and Firebase.  Before becoming a web developer, I taught college Spanish for almost twenty years. My experience in the humanities lends me a unique insight into the tech world (see the link in the "Related" section). Having technical knowledge is a requisite to being a successful developer.  However, being able to solve problems is even more important.</p>
          <p>In addition to being a web developer, I am a progressive activist.  In the course of the presidential campaign of 2016, I became a part of the movement that sprang up around the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders, volunteering to make phone calls to voters and engaging with fellow volunteers. After the election, I remained politically active, volunteering for progressive organizations such as Justice Democrats. Currently, I am doing volunteer work for Senator Sanders' 2020 campaign as a web developer.  The team I work on, Coders For Bernie Sanders, has created an AirB&B-style application for campaign staff and volunteers, called BernieBnB, currently available for download in the App and Google Play stores (see the link in the "Related" section).</p>
          <p>As I was becoming more politically engaged, I was also transitioning from the field of higher education to that of web development. This transition began in 2016, when I completed Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree, and culminated in 2019, when I completed the Front-End Web Developer and React Nanodegrees.  I was fortunate to have earned a scholarship through the Grow With Google Initiative to the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. During this program, I wrote about my career transition in a Medium blog post (see the link in the "Related" section), and earned another scholarship to the React Nanodegree.</p>
