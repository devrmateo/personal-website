          <p class="first">I am a Full Stack Web Developer with proficiency in React, Redux, React Native and Firebase.  Before becoming a web developer, I taught college Spanish for almost twenty years. My experience in the humanities lends me a unique insight into the tech world (see the link in the "Related" section). Having technical knowledge is a requisite to being a successful developer.  However, being able to solve problems is even more important.</p>
          <p>In 2018, I completed Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, for which I earned a full scholarship through the Grow With Google Initiative.  During the program, I wrote about my career transition and won the student story challenge, earning a scholarship to Udacity's React Nanodegree, which I completed in June of 2019.</p>
          <p>Starting in 2016, I began to become engaged politically.  The election, and Bernie Sanders' campaign specifically, resonated with me in a way that I had not experienced before.  I am currently volunteering for Senator Sanders' 2020 campaign as both a web developer and a community canvass leader.  At the moment, I am working with a team of other developers to create an AirB&B-style application for campaign volunteers.</p>
          <p>You can find out more about my interest in web development and politics by exploring this website.  If you like, you can also check out the aforementioned blog post that I wrote about my career transition, which was published on Udacity's Medium publication, by clicking on the link in the "Related" section.
