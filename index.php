          <p class="first">I am a Spanish instructor with twenty years of teaching experience, and a freelance web developer with certifications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL. This is my personal website.  It includes a resume section listing my work experience in both fields, as well as a web development page with links to my projects.</p>
          <p>My background in the humanities lends me a unique insight into web development (see the article in the "Related" section).  I approach every project with a critical eye.  Specifically, I want to know what the website's motivation is–why, and for whom is it being built?  Once the objective is clear, then the technical aspects tend to fall in line.  Also, I am a clear and concise communicator, and I am always up-front with my clients regarding timelines and payment.</p>
          <p>Explore this website to get to know me and see my sample projects.  If you are interested, get in touch with me using the contact form. Let's get to work!</p>
