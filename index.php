          <p class="first">I am a Full Stack Web Developer with proficiency in React, Redux, React Native and Firebase.  Before becoming a web developer, I taught college Spanish for almost twenty years. My experience in the humanities lends me a unique insight into the tech world (see the link in the "Related" section). Having technical knowledge is a requisite to being a successful developer.  However, being able to solve problems is even more important.</p>
          <p>In addition to being a web developer, I am a progressive political activist.  In the course of the presidential campaign of 2016, I became a part of the movement that sprung up around Bernie Sanders' candidacy, volunteering to make phone calls to voters and engaging with fellow volunteers. After the election, I remained politically active, volunteering for progressive organizations such as Justice Democrats. Currently, I am doing volunteer work for Senator Sanders' 2020 campaign as both a web developer and as a community canvass leader.  The team I work on, Coders For Bernie Sanders, is creating an AirB&B-style application for campaign volunteers that will be in the App and Google Play stores before the end of 2019.</p>
          <p>While I was becoming more politically engaged, I was also transitioning from the field of higher education to that of web development. This transition took place over three years, beginning in 2016, when I completed Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree and culminating in 2019, after having completed the Front-End Web Developer and React Nanodegrees.</p>
          <p>You can find out more about my interest in web development and politics by exploring this website.  You can also check out the blog post that I wrote about my career transition, which was published on Udacity's Medium publication, by clicking on the link in the "Related" section.
