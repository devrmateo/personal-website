          <p class="first">I am a Front-End Developer working to advance the progressive political agenda in the United States.  My principal skills include React, React Native, and Redux.  Before becoming a web developer, I taught college Spanish for almost twenty years. My experience in the humanities lends me a unique insight into the tech world.</p>
          <p>My transition from the field of higher education to that of web development took approximately three years to complete. It began in 2016, when I completed Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree, and culminated in 2019, when I completed the Front-End Web Developer and React Nanodegrees.  I was fortunate to have earned a scholarship through the Grow With Google Initiative to the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. During this program, I wrote about my career transition in a Medium blog post (see the link in the "Related" section), and earned another scholarship to the React Nanodegree.</p>
          <p>As I was completing my career change, I was also becoming more engaged politically.  In 2016, I became a part of the movement that sprang up around the presidential candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders, volunteering to make phone calls to voters and engaging with fellow campaign volunteers. After the election, I remained politically active, volunteering for organizations such as Justice Democrats. More recently, I volunteered for Sanders' 2020 bid as both a web developer and a Spanish call team volunteer.  The development team I worked on, Coders For Bernie Sanders, created an AirB&B-style application for the Sanders campaign's staffers and volunteers, called BernieBnB (see the link in the "Related" section). Finally, as of October, 2020, I am a volunteer front-end developer at OptOut News, a non-profit news aggregator app scheduled for release in April, 2021 (see link in the "Related" section for more info).</p>
